1. What i have done after HERE
=====================================================================
 - Study spring boot and drools, also some theoretical staffs, a little bit about RETE, ONTOLOGY...
_ and implement a small project:MIND Room MOMENTS 
__________Others staffs___________________________________
* we are doing research on negotiation protocols
* we (particularly me and Nicola) wrote an inter reg EU project proposal 80+
-
2. What i plan for the next 21 days n future
=====================================================================
- we need to have an ontology, we need to design it together
- comparison of rule engines and choose the right one for our problem domain
ðŸ˜€ i planned to run kind of workshop for students at ANCONA and study which kind of rule modeling
  language non-logic/AI people would love
- define a small case study and fully implement and integrate to the system
- defining rules
- definition/specification of rules in formal language(which decide together, FOL, PL, Description logic...many option),
 so that it will be easier to be understood by future developers and also easily maintainable


+====================================================================================
 ----what I would suggest for these 3 weeks is ..to do a small and all-inclusive app
what?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    + small scenario definition
    + definition of rules
    + formal specification (FOL)
    + Implementation (Drools and Spring Boot)
    + Integration with mind app (but first Micro-service architecture ..understand)
